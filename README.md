# Rock-Paper-Scissors
The code for a simple rock, paper, scissors game.
In here i'm gonna apply simple lessons i've learnt from javascript.
It's going to start real simple. This is merely playing vs the computer, there's no gui yet.
I'll come here later on to upgrade this code with some html and css :)


NOTE:
First commit was waaaay to late. I just went with the flow and forgot about it. (NEEDS WORKING ON!)
